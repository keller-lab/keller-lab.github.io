    <h1>How to Join the
        Keller Lab Group</h1>
    <hr>
    </div>

  <div class="text1">
    <p>We are an
        inclusive, transdisciplinary lab group working on climate risk management.
        Members of underrepresented groups and first-generation students are
        particularly encouraged to apply. There are typically openings for student
        (undergraduate and graduate), postdoc, and programmer position(s). The group has
        also hosted visiting scholars in the past.
        <br>
        <br> Below is a
        brief outline on how people typically join the group. Details can vary based on
        the type of position and other constraints. For example, for undergraduate students,
        we may skip a few steps. For graduate students that are not already admitted,
        we need to add a few steps.
    
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <p>1- Read relevant
            websites and <a
            href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qv0Gp0sAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">example
            papers</a> to judge whether this is a good fit. Note the kind of quantitative
            and transdisciplinary research we do, the approaches we use, and the
            decision-problems we analyze.</p>

        <p>2- Review the core
            values we adopt in the lab group and decide whether this is a good fit. These
            core values include transparency, accessibility, inclusivity, curiosity, life-work
            balance, contributing to solving real-world problems, and excellence.</p>

       
        <p>3- If you are
            interested and see a good fit, send an email to Klaus (<a
            href="mailto:klaus.keller@dartmouth.edu">klaus.keller@dartmouth.edu</a>) and</p>
    
        <ul>
              <li>a. Attach relevant documents as .pdf files or as
                links to a web-page</li>
              <li>b. Explain why you are reaching out to Klaus
                specifically and what your goals are</li>
              <li>c. Outline area(s) of your research interest.</li>
              <li>d. Ask specific questions</li>
              <li>e. We'll iterate via email. If this is of joint
                interest, we move to the next step (video-chats)</li>

        </ul> 
    
        <p>4- Video Chats</p>


        <ul>
            <li>a. They are intended to evaluate your verbal
                communications skills and how well you can articulate your interests</li>
            <li>b. If a video chat does not work for you, we can
                find alternatives</li>
            <li>c. No need for fancy backgrounds, formal
                presentations, or dressing up</li>
            <li>d. If this is of joint interest, we move to the
                next step (guided paper evaluation)</li>

        </ul> 

        <p>5- Guided Paper
            Evaluation</p>


            <ul>
                <li>a. Klaus will send you an email asking you to
                    provide a written evaluation of a paper, which he will provide in that email.
                    This paper will be selected based on your discussed interests. The goal of this
                    response is to get a sense of your reading, writing, and critical thinking
                    skills.</li>
                <li>b. Limit the evaluation to one page (12 point font) and address these questions:</li>


                <ul>
                     <li>i. What are the main research questions and
                        hypotheses of the paper?</li>
                    <li>ii. What are the key results?</li>
                    <li>iii. What are (potential) caveats?</li>
                    <li>iv. How would you improve on the paper?</li>

                </ul> 


                <li>c. Please return your paper evaluation within
                    seven days </li>
                <li>d. If your paper evaluation suggests you have the
                    required reading, writing, and critical thinking skills, weâ€™ll move to the next
                    step (you submitting a written application)</li>
    
            </ul> 


        <p>6- Your Application</p>

        <ul>
            <li>a. Please email a text document (.pdf file via
                email) that addresses these questions (please limit this document to three
                pages at most)</li>

            <ul>
                 <li>i. How would joining this lab group advance your
                    career and life goals?</li>
                <li>ii. What kind of project would you like to do?</li>
                <li>iii. How does your current skill-set map to the
                    needs for the project?</li>
                <li>iv. Is Klaus the right supervisor for you?</li>
                <li>v. What synergies do you see with the group?</li>


            </ul> 


            <li>b. If the application suggests a good fit and we
                can work out the logistics, we move to the next step (you meeting
                the lab group) </li>
           

        </ul> 

        <p>7- You meet the
            lab group and present your project idea</p>

            <ul>
                <li>a. Please keep this presentation short (12 min
                    max)</li>
                <li>b. Feel free to reach out to other lab-group members
                    and ask questions</li>
                <li>c. If this step suggests a good fit and we can
                    work out the logistics, we move to the last step (you joining the lab group)</li>
    
            </ul> 

        <p>8- You join the
            lab and we start the work ;-)</p>

            <p>Credit: The workflow
                has been refined over many years with inputs from students, postdocs, and colleagues.

                excellent (and much more thorough) documents written by the former lab-group
