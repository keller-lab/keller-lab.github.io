		        <h2>Prof. Klaus Keller</h2>
		        <p>Klaus serves as the Hodgson Distinguished Professor of Engineering.
              Before joining Dartmouth Engineering, Klaus Keller was a professor
              of geosciences at Penn State where he directed the Center for Climate Risk Management.
              Prior to that, he worked as a research scientist and lecturer at Princeton University 
              and as an engineer in Germany. Professor Keller graduated from Princeton with
               a PhD in civil and environmental engineering. He received master’s degrees from MIT 
               and Princeton, as well as a Diplom-Ingenieur degree from the Technische Universität Berlin.
                His research addresses two interrelated questions. First, how can we mechanistically understand past
                 and potentially predict future changes in the Earth system? Second, how can we use this information 
                 to design sustainable, scientifically sound, technologically feasible, economically efficient,
                  and ethically defensible risk management strategies? He analyzes these questions by mission-oriented 
                  basic research covering a wide range of disciplines such as engineering, Earth sciences, economics,
                   philosophy, decision science, and statistics. He contributed to reports from the Intergovernmental
                    Panel on Climate Change, co-edited an open source textbook, and published more than 150 peer-reviewed studies.
                     His research, mentoring, and service have been recognized by several prizes, for example the 2019 Penn 
                     State Outstanding Postdoc Mentor Award.</p>

                            at Stony Brook University. His research on flood risk management primarily
                             addresses two questions. First, how do physical, built and policy environments 
                             interact to produce flood risk outcomes and how are these distributed? Second, 
                             what are sustainable, technologically feasible, economically efficient,
                             and socially just responses, interventions and policies that households, 
                             local communities and governments can take or implement to be protected
                              from and resilient to the impacts of floods. He addresses these problems
                               with interdisciplinary analyses focused on practically relevant decision 
                               settings faced by those affected by or managing risks. He confronts risk 
                               in all facets of life, namely his favorite hobbies of skiing, hiking, cycling, and bouldering.</p>

                          She researches equitable climate change adaptation and mitigation responses with an emphasis on the interconnected housing and energy sectors. 
                          Lynée combines data science and co-production to identify multisector drivers of residential climate risks, like extreme heat exposure, and to assess response opportunities for the housing–energy nexus. Her data-driven research approach is decision relevant and rooted in collaborations with diverse knowledge holders and practitioners, such as state and municipal governments and community groups. She also studies procedural justice in knowledge production and decision-making processes. Lynée received her PhD in Environmental Science and Policy from the University of Miami as a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and her B.S.E. in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University. She served as a chapter author for the Fifth U.S. National Climate Assessment’s Chapter 18, “Sector Interactions, Multiple Stressors, and Complex Systems,” and she was an adjunct researcher with the RAND Corporation.</p>

                          She currently works on statistical methods for assessing and improving the information provided by physics-based models with a focus on flooding. 
                          Specifically, her methodological interests include emulation, calibration, downscaling, uncertainty quantification, Bayesian statistics, environmental statistics, and spatial/spatiotemporal statistics.
                          Prior to joining Dartmouth, she earned a PhD in Statistics from Penn State University. She has published methodological work combining information across multiple resolutions of physics-based models and application-based work on the impacts of climate change on maize yields. 
                          She has been awarded the J. Keith Ord Scholarship for Research in Spatial and Environmental Statistics, a Science Achievement Graduate Fellowship, and an Institute for Computational and Data Sciences Scholarship at Penn State. 
                          In her spare time, Samantha enjoys weight-lifting, jogging, solving sudokus and crossword puzzles, and playing card and board games.
